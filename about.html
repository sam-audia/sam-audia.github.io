            <p class="lead">Hi! I am a sophomore mechnical engineering and computer science major at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have always been enamored with the maker community and dream of one day having my own workshop, complete with a 3D printer. As such, I am very interesting in machining processes and frabrication and think that 3D printing is an important technology for the future. I created this design challenge to provide singular source of information for people to learn the basics of 3D printing in an engaging manner. My hope is that, once people are more comfortable with the technology, they will see how rewarding it is to build things for yourself. Then, once they become more confident in their craft, maybe others will join the maker community which thrives on increased collaboration.</p>
            <p class="lead">When I graduate, I hope to work in robotics and/or using computer science concepts, such as artifical intellegence, to solve engineering problems. In my free time, I like to play guitar, rock climb, and plan out future projects. </p>
